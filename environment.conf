# Each environment can have an environment.conf file. Its settings will only
# affect its own environment. See docs for more info:
# https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/config_file_environment.html

# Any unspecified settings use default values; some of those defaults are based
# on puppet.conf settings.

# If these settings include relative file paths, they'll be resolved relative to
# this environment's directory.

# Allowed settings and default values:

# modulepath = ./modules:$basemodulepath
# manifest = (default_manifest from puppet.conf, which defaults to ./manifests)
# config_version = (no script; Puppet will use the time the catalog was compiled)
# environment_timeout = (environment_timeout from puppet.conf, which defaults to 0)
    # Note: unless you have a specific reason, we recommend only setting
    # environment_timeout in puppet.conf.

# SIMP Settings #
#################
# Add support for external and/or site-specific file locations that should not
# be touched by code manager or r10k under a 'site_files' directory.
#
# This is used by the SIMP stack and certain features may not work if you don't
# have this module path in place.
#
# While each module in here is a valid module in your path, ideally there
# should only be modules of the form
# <primary_module_name>_files/files/<yourfiles here>.
#
# For example, if you were supporting the 'foo' module:
#
#   site_files/foo_files/files/foo.conf
#
# Do *not* remove basemodulepath from this!
modulepath = ./simp_modules:./modules:./site:/var/simp/environments/production/site_files:$basemodulepath
